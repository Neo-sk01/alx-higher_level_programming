Python Inheritance In Python, inheritance is a powerful object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, and the class that is inherited from is called the superclass or base class. Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes modularity in the codebase.
